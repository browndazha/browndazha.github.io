For the most part I've always been moderately tech-savvy. I've always had the ability to figure things out on my own, whether it's tech related or not. A great example of this would be when I had a MySpace account. 

I loved MySpace! Despite the fact that I wasn't of legal age to have one (I was 11 years old when I first signed up), I loved being on there & interacting with my friends. The one thing I absolutely despied though was almost **everyone** having the same profile layout. It was relatively easy to just snatch someones profile code & paste it into your profile as your own. 
So I spent countless hours watching tutorials on how to understand the different hex codes, css & html codes that I ws looking at to be able to edit a profile to my liking..

And I eventually figured it out!

I later turned that into a hobby, making custom profiles for my friends by tweaking the url-sources & text colors of pre-made codes. I even went as far as learning how to use photoshop to customize the profiles even more!

So I say all of this to say, I love building & creating new, customed things. I love seeing the final layout of something I created myself. It is a very satisfying & rewarding feeling and I would love to expand my knowledge of code to be able to build more, complex applications that can make the lives of companies & users that much easier.
